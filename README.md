# Verifiable and Transparent VRF Giveaway System
We are launching a verifiable and transparent giveaway by using the potential of the blockchain technology. Conventional giveaway systems do not provide a way to three important things:

* Is source of randomness can be manipulated?
* Is the provided results are really first execution of the giveaway?
* Is participants list manipulated?
  
We solve this problems via using some blockchain methods. Firstly, we use verifiable randommness source from Chainlink VRF. Secondly, we have deployed a smart contrat resistant to change. And finally, execution of the giveaway is only executed once and results are transparent to everyone. To not leak any personal data, we store only the hashes of the mails on the Ethereum blockchain. But to provide the results mail and user name will be stored in the database, and winners will be announced after the giveaway.
